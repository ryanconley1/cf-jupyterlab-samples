The answer should probably include the landing gear and maybe the flaps since they're part of the hydraulics/actuation system. But the context doesn't explicitly mention flaps having issues, just that the hydraulic system controls them. So the main equipment here is the landing gear. Maybe also mention the hydraulic system in general. But the user is asking for equipment that has reported issues. The only specific one mentioned is Landing Gear B. So the answer should focus on that. I need to check if there's any other equipment mentioned. The engine is mentioned as a high-bypass turbofan, but that's unrelated to hydraulic leaks.
